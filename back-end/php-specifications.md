# Selectraâ€™s back-end specifications

* Framework
* Server configuration
* Coding style
* Comments
* Deployement



## Framework

A framework **MUST** be used for the project, to make for a better code and an easier maintenance. Laravel 5 **SHOULD** be used, as most of our applications are built with it. However, if
the developer is more comfortable working with another framework, it is possible, after validation by our CTO.

## Server configuration

Since we use docker to build our apps, the developer is free to work with any PHP version he is used to.
## Coding style

The developer **MUST** follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) specifications in order to facilitate maintenance.

## Comments

The code **SHOULD** be commmented if the developers feels it's necessary. If the developer do choose to use comments in his code, the comments **MUST** follow the specifiactions
of [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/index.html)

## Deployement

  In order to optimize our workflow, our system administrator needs to be able to deploy the project without any knowledge of its inner workings. It means that the code **MUST** be shipped in such a way that it can be built easily using a well defined procedure. This procedure **MUST** be exhaustively described in a README.md file.
