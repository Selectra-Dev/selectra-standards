# How we handle the design part of our projects

During the design phase of our projects, we use two tools to allow the designers and the stake holders to communicate : Invision and Slack.

Invision is a great tool to create prototypes and allows the team to give their feedback directly on the screen.

We use slack for any other discussion related to the projetc, but is not a direct feed back on the prototype.

## Invision

The design phase works in several iterations. At the end of each iteration, the team give some feedback on the prorotypes. The we sort the screens in different categories :

 - **On hold** : Ready to receive feedback ;
 - **In progress** : Feedback ongoing ;
 - **Needs review** : The screen will need to me modified during the next iteration
 - **Approved** : The screen has been reviewed and approved by the reviewers

 We use the workflow section of invision to sort the screens, as show below :

 If some comments lead to the decsion to make a modification, we make it a tasks

 That way, we can easily track the progress of the project

## Slack

At the beginning of the project, we set up Invision to send update directly into the related slack channel. That way everybody knows what's going on, and what they have to do, without even leaving Slack !
