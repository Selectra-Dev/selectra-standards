Communication during the design phase
=

During the design phase of our projects, we use two softwares to allow the designers and the stake holders to communicate: **Invision** and **Slack**.

**Invision** is a great tool to create prototypes, as it allows the team to give their feedback directly on the screen.

We use **Slack** for any other discussion related to the project - provided this is not a direct feedback on the prototype (in such a case we would use InVision).

## Project set up

At the beginning of the project, the team chooses one or more reviewers who are responsible for giving feedback. These reviewers **MUST NOT** change mid-project, therefore it is of the utmost importance to take the time to reflect on who should be involved in the project.

## InVision

The design phase is done through several iterations. At the end of each iteration, the team gives some feedback on the prototypes. We then sort the screens in different categories:

- **On hold**: Ready to receive feedback;
- **In progress**: Feedback ongoing;
- **Needs review**: Some editing will be made on the screen during the next iteration;
- **Approved**: The screen has been reviewed and approved by the reviewers.

 We use the workflow section of InVision to sort the screens, as shown below:

 If some string of comments leads to the decision to make a modification, we **MUST** make a task out of it.

 This way, we can easily track the progress of the project. 

## Slack

At the beginning of the project, we set up an InVision integration to send updates directly into the related Slack channel. This way everybody knows the project's advancement and what they have to do, without even leaving Slack!
