This document contains the common standards for all the [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files we create.

# Table of contents

1. [Naming convention](#naming-convention.)

2. [Contents](#contents)

# Naming convention

- **MUST** use `UPPERCASE` file names.

    > They're easier to find among other files in the directory tree.

- **MUST** use underscores (`_`) to separate words in the file name.

    > Improves readability.

# Contents

- **MUST** begin document with its title - use **single** equal sign (`=`).

    > Most of the times it's humanized name (without underscores), but sometimes might contain a brief description.

- **SHOULD** contain brief description under the title.

    > It should be a indication what reader can find in it.

- **SHOULD** contain `TOC` (_table of contents_).

    > Sometimes, document isn't typical documentation or doesn't contain more than one chapter. In such case TOC can be skipped.

- **MUST NOT** contain any trailing spaces.

- Every sentence **MUST** be ended with comma (`.`).

- Titles and list items **MUST NOT** be ended with comma (`.`).
